** DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES **

A) Local Development


    1.
    - start a local proxy from cmd `local-ssl-proxy --source 3001 --target 3000`
    - run `gulp` (default) to watch server side files only
    - run `npm run wp-watch` which simply watches client side files and reloads. can't use dev-server at
        the moment because of problems connecting through sockets
2. to push use git push heroku <BRANCH_TO_PUSH>:master
